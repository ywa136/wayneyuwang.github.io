I'm currently a Data Scientist at Google, working on YouTube Ads relevance optimization and measurement.

Previously I was a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics at University of Michigan, working with [Yang Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/ychenstat/home) and [Alfred Hero](https://hero.engin.umich.edu/). I was in the Department of Statistics at University of British Columbia, where I worked with [Nhu Le](https://www.bccrc.ca/dept/ccr/people/nhu-le) and [Jim Zidek](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/james-v-zidek-frsc-oc).

My research interests lie in machine learning models for complex data, such as images, texts, and those generated from spatio-temporal processes. I've mainly used/developed tools in high-dimensional statistics, (non)convex optimization, and (approximate)Bayesian inference.
